# Building a Profitable Financial Strategy Through Focasting of Real-Time Stock Market Report Analysis
Accurate forecasting of the stock market can be a valuable tool for investors looking to make informed decisions 
and develop a profitable financial strategy. In this project, we present a streamlit app that allows users to 
compare and predict the performance of various stocks in real-time. 

The app utilizes the Yahoo Finance Python API to retrieve real-time ticker data and Facebook Prophet for forecasting. 

The app includes two main tabs: one for comparing the performance of multiple stocks, 
and another for predicting the future price of a single stock. 

By utilizing advanced forecasting techniques and real-time stock market data, this app aims to provide users 
with a powerful tool for understanding and navigating the financial market. Whether you are a seasoned investor 
or just starting out, this app can help you make informed decisions and build a successful financial strategy.
